* Highlight selected\edited snapshot with a different color in the canvas
* Put the timeline editor at the top\bottom kinda like the sidebar?
* File listing for path loading
* Some visual indicator for when the camera is locked? ("CAMERA LOCKED")
* Path frame translate  (experimental)
* Hotkey assignement tab (not high priority - might require some sdk additions)
* 3D gizmo editor (not high priority - cinder?)
* Graph editor (https://blenderartists.org/uploads/default/original/4X/3/7/a/37a98fe07c55038cd7daea9ba42e89feeafc6378.png) (not high priority)


In that case Id make it do the inverse and name it something like "Live changing smoothness (may affect performance)", and have it take integers from like 0 - 5 where at 0 its jittery and at 5 its buttery smooth
sidebar slightly visible all the time
