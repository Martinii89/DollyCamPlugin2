Version 2.1 (Feb 2020)
	SIDEBAR:
		* Editable location\rotation\POV
		* You can edit from the POV of the snapshot by clicking the "eye"
			- Clicking the eye again returns your view to where you were before 
		* Hold Alt to toggle the camere lock
		* Hold shit on any slider to move it faster
		* Ctrl-click any slider to input values manually 
		* Buttons for:
			- Rewind (rewinds a little bit before the first snapshot)
			- Activate \ Deactivate (button changes based in current state)
			- Take snapshot
		* Sidebar slightly visible all the time

	Lots of settings related to the sidebar:
		* Toggle for compact style
		* Width and height
		* The width where the sidebar transition starts
		* Toggle for if mouse should trigger transition or not.
		* Transition speed
		* The sensitivity of the location\rotation sliders
		* The update rate while editing
			- Turning this higher gives a smoother editing experience at the expense of performance\fps lag (and possible crashes in some cases)

	Some settings for toggling the visibility of:
		* Old snapshot list tab
		* Camera override tab (new)

	Misc settings stuff:
		* Dropdown menu for changing interpolation method
		* Buttons for clearing\loading\saving the path

	Timeline scrubbing:
		* There is a experimental timeline in the old snapshot list (will be moved Soonâ„¢) 

	Camera override tab (experimental):
		* Lets you override the camera settings of a player while in player cam

	Settings can be saved. And will be automatically loaded on plugin load
	Automatically stores the current path to _temp.json. This is automatically loaded on plugin load. So paths won't be lost at crash. 

	Rendered path changes:
		* Frame numbers are removed
		* White ticks\boxes are rendered at each frame
		* A visual camera is rendered at each frame during playback, so you can visually see where the camera would be pointing. 
			- cvar: (dolly_render_visualcam )

	Animation reset:
		* When the dolly is activated and hits the first frame of the path. We attempt to reset the animation of certain assets around the map

	Hitting ESC while settings window is open closes just the settings window, not the sidebar.
